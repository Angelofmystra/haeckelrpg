<p>Sophia, Queen of Brouliard, awoke from a dream-haunted slumber to a silence that seemed more like the stillness of abandoned catacombs than what is to be expected from a Royal Palace. She lay there, staring at the darkness, seeing the flickering candles all around her cast curious shadows across the the marble flooring. An intricately carved diamond vase proved much more interesting. Along its body were hexagonal shapes designed to mathematical perfection. She pondered with deep awe at the wonders of it, marvelling at the insights her scholars bestow upon her through their correspondence. “It is said that you can see God in the numbers,” she whispered softly to herself. One particular candle, a hand wide thick, and deep red, glowed and shone light through the vase, creating a myriad of refractions on the walls. One could stare at it for years and be mesmerised by the esoteric beauty. Her eyes wavered to catch a new sight. A dark shadow, the shape of a human skull, was barely discernible in a circle of light.</p>

<p>In a sudden panic, the Queen opened her mouth to call out for her maids; then she checked herself. The glow was more vivid, more refined. Her eyes widened in fear. It was a woman’s skull, small and delicately molded, which seemed to grow more distinct as she stared at it. A cry froze in her throat. The door to her chamber swung open, startling her. She looked to the door and saw a maid entering. The Queen quickly turned back but the shadow vanished. Her eyes navigated all the crevices and shadows of the room, searching for that lost image. “Did you see that?” she said desperately to the Maid. </p>

<p>The servant girl responded, “No your highness,” a tinge of fear ran through the voice of the girl, fearing that she was being disagreeable. </p>

<p>The Queen responded with a flash of anger, “Go!” dismissing her. The servant girl made haste to leave the room.</p>

<p>Her bed chamber was not the warm comfortable resting place most would expect; immense in size, with a high vaulted ceiling, it was an architectural magnificence of the era. The east wing of her chamber contained a number of mahogany book shelves filled with ancient wisdoms that engaged her brilliant mind on a daily basis. The west wing’s wall proudly displayed numerous paintings, each masterfully crafted by the most famous painters of Her Royal Majesty's’ Kingdom. But neither of these had caught her interest. Through the mosaic windows, the spark of dawn rose patiently and in that moment she had one singular thought; there was much work to be done.</p>

<p>She rose from her bed, and graced meditatively towards her writing table, reminiscing on the past, present, and future. Her gentle hand moved towards the ink quill by her side, and she began to write in her Diary… </p>

<p><i>This country holds much promise, but it is trapped in a state of horrible barbarism. The hearts of my people are gripped by the icy fingers of terror, unknowing of the merciless horrors of the world. But across the plains of this realm, I command the future. Barely a year ago I recall the face of my Husband as I wrought oblivion on his armies. There is no greater goal than rescuing this world from superstition and misery. No one will stop me from ushering a new age brighter and beyond the imagination of Man - The Enlightenment of Brouliard. </i></p>
